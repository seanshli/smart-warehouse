# How to Create Working Team Accounts

## Why This Error Occurs

When you try to add a member to a community or working group, you'll see an error if the user doesn't exist yet. This is **correct behavior** - users must be created first before they can be added to communities, buildings, or working groups.

## Steps to Create a Working Team Account

### Method 1: Create User First, Then Add to Community (Recommended)

1. **Go to Admin Users Page**
   - Navigate to `/admin/users` in your browser
   - Or click the link in the error message

2. **Click "Create User" Button**
   - Click the "+ Create User" button at the top of the users list

3. **Fill in User Details**
   - **Name**: Enter the user's name (e.g., "Front Desk Staff")
   - **Email**: Enter the email address (e.g., "frontdesk03@twinoak.dom")
   - **Password**: Set a password for the user
   - **Phone** (optional): Enter phone number

4. **Select User Type**
   - Choose **"Working Team"** from the "User Type" dropdown

   - **Role**: Choose the role (MEMBER, MANAGER, or ADMIN)

6. **Click "Create"**
   - The user will be created AND automatically added to the selected community/building

   - Go back to the Community page → Working Groups tab
   - Click on a working group
   - Click "Add Member"
   - Select the user from the dropdown (they should now appear)

### Method 2: Quick Create from Community Page

1. **Click the error message link**
   - When you see "User not found" error, click the link to go to Admin Users page
