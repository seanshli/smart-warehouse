# 🚀 Move Smart Warehouse to Local Folder

## ⚠️ Problem: Dropbox is Causing Issues

The EPIPE errors and slow startup are because:
- Dropbox is syncing files while Next.js tries to write to them
- File system conflicts between Dropbox and Next.js
- Slow performance due to cloud sync overhead

## ✅ Solution: Move to Local Folder

### Quick Method (Copy & Paste in Terminal):

```bash
# 1. Create Projects folder (if it doesn't exist)
mkdir -p ~/Projects

# 2. Copy the entire project
cp -R /Users/seanli/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/EE/enGo/SW/cursor ~/Projects/smart-warehouse

# 3. Navigate to new location
cd ~/Projects/smart-warehouse

# 4. Start the server
npm run dev
```

### Alternative Locations:

**Option 1: Documents folder**
```bash
cp -R /Users/seanli/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/EE/enGo/SW/cursor ~/Documents/smart-warehouse
cd ~/Documents/smart-warehouse
npm run dev
```

**Option 2: Desktop**
```bash
cp -R /Users/seanli/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/EE/enGo/SW/cursor ~/Desktop/smart-warehouse
cd ~/Desktop/smart-warehouse
npm run dev
```

**Option 3: Custom location**
```bash
cp -R /Users/seanli/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/EE/enGo/SW/cursor /path/to/your/preferred/location
cd /path/to/your/preferred/location
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 After Moving:

1. **Navigate to new location**
2. **Run:** `npm run dev`
3. **Should start FAST** (2-3 seconds)
4. **No EPIPE errors**
5. **No stuck "Starting..."**

## 🔧 What Gets Copied:

Everything you need:
- ✅ All source code
- ✅ node_modules (dependencies)
- ✅ Database with demo data
- ✅ .env.local with your OpenAI key
- ✅ All configuration files

## 💡 Benefits of Local Folder:

- ⚡ Much faster startup
- 🛡️ No Dropbox sync conflicts
- 🚀 Better performance
- ✅ Reliable file operations

## ⚠️ About the Original Dropbox Copy:

You can:
- **Keep it** as a backup
- **Delete it** after confirming local version works
- **Use it** for syncing code between computers (but run locally)

## 🎉 Recommended Setup:

1. **Development**: Run from local folder (`~/Projects/smart-warehouse`)
2. **Backup**: Keep copy in Dropbox (or use git)
3. **Version Control**: Initialize git in local folder

```bash
cd ~/Projects/smart-warehouse
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Smart Warehouse setup"
```

**Move to a local folder to fix the startup issues!** 🚀
